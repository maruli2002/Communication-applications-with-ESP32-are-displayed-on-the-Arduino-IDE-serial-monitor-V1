The following is a description for an Android app created in Android Studio using the Kotlin language:
Communication Application with ESP32 using Android Studio

This application is designed to facilitate communication between Android devices and the ESP32. Developed in Android Studio with the Kotlin programming language, this application allows users to connect Android devices to the ESP32 via Bluetooth, send and receive data, as well as monitor information such as MAC address and IP address (fake IP address for demonstration purposes) of the ESP32.

Key Features:
- Connect: Button to connect Android device with ESP32 via Bluetooth.
- Send: Feature to send data from an Android device to the ESP32, which will then be received and processed by the ESP32.
- Enter Data: Input form that allows users to enter data that will be sent to the ESP32.
- Delivery Monitor: Display that shows data delivery status and other information such as MAC address and IP address of the ESP32.
- Fake MAC Address and IP: Feature to display a fake MAC address and IP address from the ESP32 on the Android screen, which can be seen by the user.

Any communication that occurs between the Android application and the ESP32 can also be monitored via the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE, providing full visibility of the data sent and received.
